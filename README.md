## About Tailwind 

<h4>Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.</h4>
<p>A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.</p>

<!-- - [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing). -->
- [It’s tiny — never ship unused CSS again]
- Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it could possibly be. In fact, most Tailwind projects ship less than 10kB of CSS to the client.
- [Build whatever you want, seriously]

- Because Tailwind is so low-level, it never encourages you to design the same site twice. Even with the same color palette and sizing scale, it's easy to build the same component with a completely different look in the next project.
